// The class provides two interfaces:  The find/update functions keep
// track of the Xic cell names created, with a status flag.  The
// getMasterName group takes care of cell name aliasing.  Aliasing is
// needed to avoid name clashes with Xic library devices, and in the
// situation where a design reads the same cell name from two
// different libraries.  It also generates pcell sub-master names.
